### Two Mode Networks
This is an activity I created using Harry Potter data. It is designed to teach students how to map two mode networks and projecting the duality between characters and groups. I collected the data from the [Harry Potter Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

First, mapping characters' relationships to groups in the serries.

Third, I have student stake a look at the symbolic connections between groups who share students. An obvious "good" and "bad" divide here!
