# Teaching
I love teaching! I seek to prodive every opportunity for a student to succeed in my classroom whether I am teaching sociology or data science. I strive for teaching and mentoring excellence with special interest in emphasising diversity throughout my teaching. I largely follow a student-centred teaching model (see the [ADAPT Model](https://datascienceacademy.ncsu.edu/courses/course-model/) I have co-built with NCSU DSA) which emphasises student agency and project-based learning. Please review this document for [evidence of my teaching effectiveness](/Effectivness_of_Teaching.pdf). Here is a list of my teaching experience. 

## Sociology 
- SOC 202 Introduction to Sociology
- SOC 205 Jobs and Work

## Data Science
- DSA 295 Introduciton to Network Analysis
- Peer Scholars Program - Social Network Analysis
- Asynchronous - Social Network Analysis
  
## Example Teaching Material
### Two Mode Networks
This is an activity I created using Harry Potter data. It is designed to teach students how to map two mode networks and projecting the duality between characters and groups. I collected the data from the [Harry Potter Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

First, mapping characters' relationships to groups in the serries.

Second, I have studnets take a look at the symbolic connections between students who share group affiliations.

Third, I have student stake a look at the symbolic connections between groups who share students. An obvious "good" and "bad" divide here!
