I love teaching! I generally follow a student-centred teaching model (see the [ADAPT model](https://datascienceacademy.ncsu.edu/courses/course-model/) that I have co-developed at NCSU DSA) which emphasises student agency and project-based learning. I really love teaching methods courses and substantive courses. Please see [here](/Effectivness_of_Teaching.pdf) for evidence of my teaching effectiveness.

### Two Mode Networks
This is an activity I created using Harry Potter data. It is designed to teach students how to map two mode networks and projecting the duality between characters and groups. I collected the data from the [Harry Potter Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

First, mapping characters' relationships to groups in the serries.

Second, I have studnets take a look at the symbolic connections between students who share group affiliations.

Third, I have student stake a look at the symbolic connections between groups who share students. An obvious "good" and "bad" divide here!
