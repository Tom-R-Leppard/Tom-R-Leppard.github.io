# Visualising Grime
For my dissertation, I studies the collaboraitons between Grime musicians. Grime is a UK-based rap genre that emerged from the east London reggae and Garage scene in the early 2000s. Broadly speaking, my dissertation investigated how the network embeddedness influenced the career success of 122 Grime artists. I codded the collaborations on Spotify over a 22 year period. From this, I generated directed networks for each year. The direction of each connection is based on whether an artist appears on another artist's Spotify profile (working on their songs) or if others appear on their profile (collaborating on their songs). Here is a small collection of various visualisations I have created to showcase some of my work on this genre of music.
