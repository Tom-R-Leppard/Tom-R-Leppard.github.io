For my dissertation, I studies the collaboraitons between Grime musicians. Grime is a UK-based rap genre that emerged from the east London reggae and Garage scene in the early 2000s. Broadly speaking, my dissertation investigated how the network embeddedness influenced the career success of 122 Grime artists. I codded the collaborations on Spotify over a 22 year period. From this, I generated directed networks for each year. The direction of each connection is based on whether an artist appears on another artist's Spotify profile (working on their songs) or if others appear on their profile (collaborating on their songs). Here is a small collection of various visualisations I have created to showcase some of my work on this genre of music. 

## Grime Networks Overtime 
Here are a selection of network descriptives that I have taken from each year of the networks. 

## Communities of Collaborators
I ran some community detection Grime. I present the modularity of the networks taken over time and also a few years work of the networks depicting the communities I detected. 

## Grime in 3D
These are some 3D interactive networks from a few years of the genre.

The colours of the nodes in these networks represent a unique measure of reciprocity I developed in my dissertation. Blue spheres represent "givers" — artists whose collaborations mostly appear on other artists' profiles, meaning they have more outward connections than inward. Green spheres represent "takers" — artists who receive more collaborations than they give, meaning they have more inward connections than outward. Purple spheres represent "reciprocators" — artists who give and receive collaborations in equal measure, maintaining a balanced exchange. Red spheres represent artists who have never collaborated with anyone in the network. 

## Grime Collaborations Overtime
This is an ndtv network movie depicting the collaborations of Grime artists over the 22 year period I observed. For this visual, I removed isolated artists from each year.
