I am interested in how social inequalities influence peopleâ€™s access to and returns from social capital in networks and across social domains such as school, family, and mentorship. Professional opportunities are shaped by the distribution of tangible and intangible resources available to people through social connection and embeddedness. My current research focuses on how these factors contribute to enduring social inequalities across multiple social domains and contexts.

Across multiple articles, I demonstrate how social inequalities operate differently across contexts in society. In this effort I leverage domain-specific theories of inequality like family social capital, competition in creative ecologies, racial positional segregation in sports (stacking), and the leaky pipeline of STEM in higher education. To do this I have built expertise using multiple data types including social network data, longitudinal survey data, text data, and process data for business analytics.
