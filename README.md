I am interested in how social inequalities affect individualsâ€™ access to, and returns from, social capital within networks across various domains. My current research focuses on family, sports, music, and education. I examine how both tangible and intangible resources, gained through connections or structural positions (such as one's power, professional role, or network centrality), influence profesional opportunities and contribute to persistent social inequalities.

To investigate this, I draw on domain-specific theories including family social capital, racial positional segregation in sports (stacking), competition in creative industries, and the leaky pipeline in STEM education. My research utilizes a variety of data types such as social network, longitudinal survey, text, and process data.
