I am interested in how social inequalities affect individuals' access to, and returns from, social capital within networks across various domains such as family and work. My current research focuses on how both tangible and intangible resources, gained through connections and embeddedness, influence peopleâ€™s professional opportunities and contribute to persistent social inequalities.

To investigate this, I draw on domain-specific theories including family social capital, competition in creative industries, racial positional segregation in sports (stacking), and the leaky pipeline in STEM education. My research utilizes a variety of data types such as social network, longitudinal survey, text, and process data.
