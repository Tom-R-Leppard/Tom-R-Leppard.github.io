I am interested in how social inequalities influence young peopleâ€™s access to and returns from social capital in networks and across social domains such as school, family, and mentorship. Professional opportunities are shaped by the distribution of tangible and intangible resources available to people through social connection and embeddedness. My current research focuses on how these factors affect adolescents as they transition into adulthood. I also study social capital in collaboration networks in music, and positional segregation (a.k.a "stacking") in sports.
