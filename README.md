**I study how social structures, social networks, and culture shape life outcomes.**
My research examines how individuals' social networks and group structures influence access to material and symbolic resources, and how these patterns reproduce or mitigate inequality. I have am particularly interested in domains such as family, sport, music, and education, where cultural norms and institutional rules shape the flows of resources. By combining theory with diverse methods—including social network analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and text-based approaches—I investigate how networks and group memberships affect outcomes such as occupational attainment, education trajectories, and career performance. My work draws on both original and secondary data and reflects a growing agenda of collaboration across social contexts and disciplines.

A central theme of my agenda is social capital: the ways in which ties to others confer advantages or impose constraints. I explore how group boundaries, institutional hierarchies, and cultural norms—such as gendered expectations within families, status structures in creative industries, and racialised dynamics in sport—mediate access to resources. Across projects, I aim to show how networks and social ties can simultaneously reproduce inequality and enable mobility, highlighting the structural and cultural mechanisms that link social position to life outcomes. For example, in [Emerging Adulthood](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/NZTFGYWIEKHFB8MDTXZG/full) I examine how family social capital shapes young adults’ career goals, while in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.13029) I trace how intersectional inequalities tied to the criminal justice system transform social capital during adolescence.
