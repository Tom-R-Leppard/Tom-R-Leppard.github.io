**I study how social structures shape opportunity.**
My research examines how individuals navigate systems of inequality through their relationships, group memberships, and positions within broader social networks. I focus on domains such as family, sport, music, and education. These are contexts where material and symbolic resources are exchanged, and where access to those resources can shape life outcomes, including occupational attainment, educational pathways, and career performance.

A central thread in my work is the role of social capital: how ties to others facilitate or constrain opportunity. I explore how group boundaries and institutional rules — including gender norms of family, status hierarchies in creative industries, or racialization in sport — structure these exchanges. Resource flows within networks are never neutral; they are shaped by the social and cultural environments in which actors are embedded. 

These interests have generated a broad research agenda and a large network of collaborators. Across projects, I aim to reveal how group dynamics and social ties reproduce or resist inequality. For example, in my recent article in [Emerging Adulthood](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/NZTFGYWIEKHFB8MDTXZG/full) I demonstrate how a relatively eassily-accesible form of social capital - familial - can benefit a young person's career development. 

I am also really interested in methods! My research combines theory-driven questions matched with diverse methods. I have built expertise in social network analysis, statistical inference and modelling, machine learning, and tex-based techniques. I collect data, use existing data and love working on new projects.
