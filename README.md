# Sociologist, Postdoctoral Scholar, Research Scientist
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Data Science Academy at North Carolina State University.

I study how social inequalities influence young people’s access to and returns from social capital in networks, and across social domains such as school, family, and mentorship. The main theme of my research centers on how professional opportunities are shaped by the distribution of tangible and intabgile resources available to people through social connection and embeddedness. My current research focuses on how these factors affect adolescents as they transition into adulthood. In line with my focus on interpersonal relationships and social capital, I also study collaboration networks in music and positional segregation (a.k.a. stacking) in sports.

### Example Teaching Material
#### Two Mode Networks
This is an activiy I created using Harry Potter data. It is designed to teach students how to map two mode networks and projecting the duality between characters and groups. I collected the data from the [Harry Potter Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

First, mapping characters' relationships to groups in the serries.

Second, I have studnets take a look at the symbolic connections between students who share group affiliations.

Third, I have student stake a look at the symbolic connections between groups who share students. An obvious "good" and "bad" divide here!
