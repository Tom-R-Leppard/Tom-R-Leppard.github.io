I'm studying how social inequalities impact people's ability to access and benefit from social connections in different areas like family, sports, music, and education. I look at both the concrete and more subtle resources people get through their relationships or their position in social networks. These resources can affect life opportunities (viz. career, education, relationships) and contribute to ongoing social inequalities.

To investigate this, I draw on domain-specific theories pertaining to family social capital, criminal justice contact, adolescent delinquency, racial positional segregation in sports (stacking), competition in creative industries, and the leaky pipeline in STEM education. My research utilises a variety of data types such as social network, longitudinal survey, text, and process data.
