**I study how social structures shape opportunity.**
My research focuses on the ways that individuals navigate systems of inequality through their relationships, group memberships, and positions in broader social networks. I’m especially interested in how domains like family, sport, music, and education structure access to resources — both material and symbolic — and how those resources impact trajectories throughout the life-course.

Much of my work explores social capital: how ties to others can help or hinder outcomes like career attainment, education, and wellbeing. I also examine how social meaning is embedded in group boundaries and institutional rules — for example, in how inequality is reproduced through interactions, how artists collaborate in competitive cultural spaces, or how athletes are racialized in sport. As such, my work spans multiple sociological sub-topics by focusing on how individuals and groups shape — and are shaped by — systems of inequality.  In all projects, I aim to reveal how group dynamics and social ties reproduce — or resist — inequality. An example is my recent article in [Emerging Adulthood](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/NZTFGYWIEKHFB8MDTXZG/full) which demonstrates how a relatively eassily-accesible form of social capital can benefit a young person's career development. My research combines theory-driven inquiry with diverse methods, including social network analysis, statistical inference (i.e. using longitudinal survey data), and tex-based techniques. I use both original data I collect, and existing data that have already been collected.
