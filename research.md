# Research
Here is a selection of my work. Coupled with these, I have several either under review or on the way. See my [CV](/cv.pdf) for a more up-to-date picture of my research agenda. Research is a passion for me. I focus on social inequality with emphasis on social capital and social networks. I really love driving research and I also enjoy supporting the efforts of others as a collaborator.
