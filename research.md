My work explores how social capital and structural inequality shape life outcomes across youth, family, and cultural domains. Using quantitative and social network-based methods, I examine the intersections of inuqualites associated with race, gender, and class in institutions like sports, education, and the labor market. My work demonstrates that understanding people's social embeddedness is key in discerning how social inqualities endure.  My research is currently funded by the [National Science Foundation - 2222148](https://datascienceacademy.ncsu.edu/dsa-postdoc/). 

As someone interested in resources and networks, I love building scholarly communities, and much of my work is collaborative! I also thoroughly enjoy driving my solo research agenda. Please refer to my [CV](/cv.pdf) for an updated overview of my research agenda. Here is a selection of my published work and a few other projects I am working on.
