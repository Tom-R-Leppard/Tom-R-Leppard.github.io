My work explores how social capital, inequality, and networks influence opportunities and outcomes in various contexts. As someone interested in resources and networks, I love building scholarly communities, and much of my work is collaborative! I also thoroughly enjoy driving my solo research agenda. Please refer to my [CV](/cv.pdf) for an updated overview of my research agenda.
