# Network Tutorials
Here are some free tutorials that I wrote for my students and others interested in social network analysis in R. I believe in making computational skills accessible to everyone, so you'll see that I use some fun data (e.g., Harry Potter, UK Grime music, etc.) to teach network principles and R skills. I find these appeal to a very broad student body
